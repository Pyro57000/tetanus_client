Hello I'm (name fill this out) from (it firm fill this out). We were brought in to help your normal IT guys with some of the menial tasks so they can focus on more import improvement projects. As part of this we're making sure our inventory management system is checking in correctly and up to date, this should only take a minute or two. Is now bad time to talk?

Great I just need to confirm that my inventory report here is accurate.

Are you currently running Windows 11?

can you confirm your user name is (metadata username)?

great and your email is (email enumeration finding)?

Your primary browser is firfox?

Oh thats strange it seems our report is wrong then... I don't think our program on your computer is checking in correctly... uhhh I want to make sure you're getting all the windows updates we need to be compliant.

Hold the windows key on your keyboard and press the r button. in the box that opens up type cmd.exe and press enter.

This will open a scary black box, but don't worry I'll walk you through what we need here, it'll be pretty easy.

In that box type systemifo all one word and press enter.

Scroll up through that output and find the section that talks about hotfixes, how many are installed?

That doesn't seem like the right number to me, can you read me the last 3 that are listed there?

yeah you're definitely not getting all of the windows updates. This is going to take a bit of troubleshooting to figure out. Would you mind hopping in a Zoom call with me and sharing your screen so I can check a few things? This should only take a couple of minutes.

(open up the services manager and scroll through it, check some program files folders, and run a few commands in cmd to act like I'm troubleshooting.)

Hmmm everything looks ok on this end. I'm going to do some troubleshooting on the server side and see if we can get to the bottom of this. I don't think we'll need anything else from you to fix this, but if that changes I'll let you know.  Thank you for your time.
