have you been vished before?
- [ ] yes
- [ ] no


if yes:
	what was the purpose of that attack? 
	- [ ] gain a foothold
	- [ ] get protected data
	- [ ] steal money

Our vishing tests generally have four main objectives

1. verbial confirmation of information
2. run commands on the system they're on
3. go to a specific website
4. join a screen shareing session with us and grant remote control

This simulates an attacker gaining a foothold on the network via vishing.

Are these objectives what you want to test for?

- [ ] yes
- [ ] no

custom objectives:

- (continue as needed)

Our default pretext is 3rd party IT

We'll call in claiming to be employees at an IT firm that were brought in to handle some of the basic maintence tasks such as computer inventory and updates.

We'll claim the inventory system had a glitch and that we're calling a few people to verify the information in our spreadsheet is correct.

We'll have the target verify some basic information about their computer and verify any information we can gather via OSINT

We'll then fabricate a reason to believe that our spreadsheet is incorrect and that it would require farther troubleshooting.

We'll ask them to run a few commands and read us the output to confirm this

We'll then offer a zoom call so they can share screen and speed up the troubleshooting process.

Does this pretext sound ok to you?

- [ ] yes
- [ ] no
